# Unsupervised Learning for Tumor Segmentation in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

## 1. Executive Summary

This study employs unsupervised learning techniques to analyze the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset. Our goal is to identify distinct groups of breast tumors based on their cellular characteristics, potentially uncovering new insights into tumor classification and improving diagnostic procedures. We used K-Means clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, complemented by dimensionality reduction techniques. The analysis revealed a complex structure within the data, suggesting a spectrum of tumor characteristics rather than clearly delineated categories. This insight could lead to more nuanced diagnostic approaches and personalized treatment strategies in breast cancer care.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1. Main Objective of the Analysis

The primary objective is to utilize unsupervised learning techniques to identify and characterize distinct groups of breast tumors based on their cellular features. This approach aims to enhance our understanding of tumor variability and potentially improve diagnostic procedures and personalized treatment strategies in breast cancer care.

### 2.2. Background on Breast Cancer Diagnosis

Breast cancer diagnosis typically involves imaging techniques and tissue analysis, often using Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA). While traditional approaches categorize tumors as benign or malignant, our unsupervised learning techniques aim to reveal more nuanced groupings that may not align perfectly with this binary classification.

## 3. Dataset Description

### 3.1. Overview of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset

The dataset consists of 569 samples with 30 features each, computed from digitized images of FNA of breast masses. These features describe various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images.

### 3.2. Feature Significance in Breast Cancer Diagnosis

Key features include radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension of cell nuclei. These characteristics are known to differ between benign and malignant cells.

## 6. Model Evaluation and Interpretation

### 6.1. Selection of Final Model

After evaluating K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN, we have selected Hierarchical Clustering as our final model for this analysis.

### 6.2. Justification for the Chosen Model

1. Interpretability: The dendrogram provides a clear, visual representation of the data structure, allowing for intuitive interpretation at various levels of granularity.
2. Flexibility: It allows us to examine the data structure at multiple levels, from broad categories to finer subtypes.
3. Alignment with Biological Reality: The hierarchical structure aligns well with the biological understanding of cancer progression and subtypes.
4. Robustness to Cluster Shapes: It doesn't assume spherical cluster shapes, making it more adaptable to the potentially complex structure of breast cancer data.
5. Consistency: The results showed more stability across different runs compared to K-Means.

### 6.3. How it Best Addresses the Analysis Objectives

1. Tumor Subtype Identification: The hierarchical structure allows for the identification of main tumor types while also revealing subtypes within these main categories.
2. Spectrum of Characteristics: It captures the spectrum of tumor characteristics, aligning with our finding that breast cancer presents more as a continuum than distinct categories.
3. Insight into Tumor Progression: The hierarchical structure can potentially offer insights into the progression of tumors.
4. Adaptability to Clinical Use: Clinicians can choose the level of granularity that's most useful for their specific diagnostic or research purposes.
5. Facilitates Further Research: The hierarchical structure provides a framework for more detailed investigation into specific subgroups or transition points between tumor types.

### 6.4. Cross-Validation for Clustering

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

def kmeans_cv(X, n_clusters, n_splits=5):
    kf = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
    silhouette_scores = []

    for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X):
        X_train, X_test = X[train_index], X[test_index]
        kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)
        kmeans.fit(X_train)
        test_labels = kmeans.predict(X_test)
        score = silhouette_score(X_test, test_labels)
        silhouette_scores.append(score)

    return np.mean(silhouette_scores), np.std(silhouette_scores)

mean_score, std_score = kmeans_cv(scaled_features, n_clusters=3)
print(f"Average Silhouette Score: {mean_score:.3f} (Â±{std_score:.3f})")
```

### 6.5. Interpretation Techniques

```python
import shap
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree

# Create a function that returns the distance to each cluster center
def cluster_distance(X):
    distances = []
    for i in range(3):  # Assuming 3 clusters
        cluster_samples = scaled_features[hierarchical_labels == i]
        cluster_center = np.mean(cluster_samples, axis=0)
        distance = np.linalg.norm(X - cluster_center, axis=1)
        distances.append(distance)
    return np.array(distances).T

# Sample a subset of data for SHAP analysis
sample_size = 100
sample_indices = np.random.choice(scaled_features.shape[0], sample_size, replace=False)
sampled_features = scaled_features[sample_indices]

# SHAP values for feature importance
explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(cluster_distance, sampled_features)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(sampled_features)

# Plot SHAP summary
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, sampled_features, plot_type="bar", feature_names=X.columns)

# Plot feature distributions for each cluster
fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(15, 15))
axes = axes.ravel()

for i, feature in enumerate(X.columns[:4]):  # Plot first 4 features as an example
    for cluster in np.unique(hierarchical_labels):
        axes[i].hist(scaled_features[hierarchical_labels == cluster, i], alpha=0.5, label=f'Cluster {cluster}')
    axes[i].set_title(f'Distribution of {feature}')
    axes[i].set_xlabel('Scaled Feature Value')
    axes[i].set_ylabel('Frequency')
    axes[i].legend()

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Surrogate Decision Tree
surrogate_tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
surrogate_tree.fit(scaled_features, hierarchical_labels)
plt.figure(figsize=(20,10))
plot_tree(surrogate_tree, feature_names=X.columns, filled=True, class_names=[f'Cluster {i}' for i in range(3)])
plt.show()
```

## 10. Conclusion

This unsupervised learning analysis of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset has revealed a complex structure within tumor characteristics, suggesting a spectrum rather than discrete categories. While supporting the traditional binary classification, our findings uncover potential subtypes and a continuum of features that could significantly impact diagnosis and treatment strategies.

The hierarchical clustering model provided the most comprehensive view of the data structure, highlighting the potential for more nuanced diagnostic approaches. The implementation of cross-validation and interpretability techniques enhances the robustness and clinical relevance of our findings.

These insights underscore the need for personalized medicine in breast cancer treatment and open up new avenues for research in tumor classification and progression. As we move forward, integrating these findings into clinical practice could lead to more accurate diagnoses, tailored treatment plans, and ultimately, better patient outcomes.

However, it's crucial to address the limitations of this study, particularly the unsupervised nature of the analysis and the need for clinical validation. Future work should focus on validating these findings with larger, more diverse datasets and clinical trials before implementation in healthcare settings.

By combining data-driven insights with clinical expertise, we can work towards a more nuanced and effective approach to breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, potentially improving outcomes for patients worldwide.
